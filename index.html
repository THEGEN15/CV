<p> A lebanese 20 year old pre med college student born in 25th of december 2001 in Zgharta north lebanon, and currently living in koura north lebanon district. I am also a volunteer in the Lebanese Red Cross Youth (LRCY) department and i have been for almost 4 years now. One of the main subjects that we are working on in the LRCY  is the HVP program which stands for human values and principles, and the reason why i am talking about this program is because my live goal is the same as the one the this program is made to achieve which is to create a world where everyone can live freely without being discriminated no matter what race/gender/religion... And the reason this goal isnt far fetched because no one was born hating others because of their skin color or religion or gender, they were taught to hate which means that they can be taught to love and respect them, for love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite.
